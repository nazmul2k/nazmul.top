We can access cPanel by simply typing "yourdomain.com/cpanel" in the address bar of our browser. Then we have to provide our log in details in there. But what will happen if we do not have the username and password or we forget it?

## How can we recover our cPanel username and password?
In today’s article, we will discuss the step by step process of how we can see or in some cases, recover our cPanel login credentials.

## Find cPanel password by email
1. Go to your email account which you had used when you created your hosting account.
2. Search by your hosting provider name and search for the email containing your hosting credentials. There you will find your CPanel login details also.

If you are unable to find that email or deleted that email then do not worry. Follow the next steps and you will be able to access your cPanel Insha-Allah.

## Login via hosting portal
1. Go to your hosting provider’s website and log in there. Find the option called log in to cPanel or something similar to it.
2. Click on it and you will be redirected into your cPanel and you do not have to give any login information. You will be logged in automatically.

Do not worry, I know the process is really time-consuming and hesitating. Just copy your username from there and log out. If you already know your username then you can skip this step.

## Reset cPanel password
1. Go to “yourdomain.com/cpanel” and click on reset password.
2. Then you will be asked for a username. Paste the username you have copied earlier and click on reset password.
3. Then you will be asked for your email address. There will be an email address hint. Type the full email address there and click on send security code.
4. Log in to your email address and find the email containing the security code.
5. Copy the security code and paste it there.
6. At this point, you will be asked for a new password.
7. Create a strong password and confirm it by double typing it in the Confirm Password section.
8. Then click on the Set Password button.

**Congratulations!** you have successfully reset your CPanel password. However, if you are unable to recover your password in that way, then do not worry. Follow the next steps.

## Ask Hosting provider to reset the Password
1. Log in to your hosting provider’s website.
2. Open a support ticket remarking the cPanel login problem.
3. Let them know that you have lost your cPanel credentials.
4. Follow their instructions properly. They can ask you some simple personal questions. Try to answer those questions properly.

Then they will help you to reset your password Insha-Allah.
